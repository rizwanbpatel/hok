Chandan is back with his array to blow your mind. As usual Chandan has an array consisting of N integers .He allows you to perform 2 kinds of operation on his array.

    Type 1 : Increment any integer of the array by 1.

    Type 2 : Decrement any integer of the array by 1.

You can perform these operation as many times as you want on his array.

Each operation of Type 1 costs 3 while each operation of Type 2 costs 5.

Now Chandan wants to have K equal elements in his array.So he asks you to tell him the minimum cost required in obtaining K equal elements in his array.

Input:

The first line contains T indicating test cases.Second line contains 2 integers N indicating the number of elements in his array and K.

Third line contains N space separated integers denoting Chandan array.

Output:

The minimum cost required to get K equal elements.

Constraints :

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤100

1 ≤ A[i] ≤100


SAMPLE INPUT

1
5 3
9 4 9 7 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT

6

Explanation

We can convert 7 to 9 to get three 9. The cost of this conversion will be 6.
